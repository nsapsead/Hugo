### The Paradox of the White Belt Instructor

White belt instructors are often the subject of jokes and ridicule within the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu community. It is not uncommon to read online, or hear about the 2 stripe white belt ‘Professor’. However, despite the stigma, I believe that there is a benefit to harnessing the ‘White Belt Instructor’ mindset. 

One of the primary advantages of white belts is that they possess a fresh perspective and a level of enthusiasm that higher ranking belts may have lost over time. This excitement can be contagious and can help motivate beginners who may feel overwhelmed or intimidated by the complexities of the sport. White belts can also provide a relatable figure for beginners, someone who has recently gone through the same struggles they are facing, and can empathise with their frustrations and mistakes.

Teaching can also be a great way for white belts to solidify their understanding of the art. When you are tasked with teaching a technique or concept, you are forced to break it down into its simplest components, which can help you gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics and principles behind it. As the saying goes, "if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." By teaching beginners, white belts are enhancing their own understanding of the art.

It is important to note, however, that there are limitations to what white belt instructors should be teaching. White belts should focus on basic techniques and concepts that are fundamental to the art, and avoid trying to teach advanced techniques or strategies beyond their level of understanding. It is also crucial for white belt instructors to recognise their own limitations and not overestimate their knowledge or abilities.

Finally, embracing and encouraging a mindset where white belts can learn to breakdown and understand a technique, to a level where they can reliably teach this to a beginner will result in a better experience for all students.  It is incumbent on senior belts to shift away from ridicule of this practice and instead encourage this within a solid framework of feedback and improvement. By doing so, we can all contribute to a positive and supportive learning environment within the Jiu-Jitsu community.
