# The Paradox of White Belts teaching new students

White belt instructors are often the subject of jokes and ridicule within the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu community. It is not uncommon to hear other practitioners sarcastically ask, "How many stripes do you have? Two or three stripes?" However, despite the stigma, there are several benefits to learning something to a level that you are able to teach it.

One of the primary advantages of having white belt instructors is that they possess a fresh perspective and a level of enthusiasm that higher ranking belts may have lost over time. This excitement can be contagious and can help motivate beginners who may feel overwhelmed or intimidated by the complexities of the sport. White belts can also provide a relatable figure for beginners, someone who has recently gone through the same struggles they are facing, and can empathize with their frustrations and mistakes.

Teaching can also be a great way for white belts to solidify their understanding of the art. When you are tasked with teaching a technique or concept, you are forced to break it down into its simplest components, which can help you gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics and principles behind it. As the saying goes, "if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." By teaching beginners, white belts are enhancing their own understanding of the art.

It is important to note, however, that there are limitations to what white belt instructors should be teaching. White belts should focus on basic techniques and concepts that are fundamental to the art, and avoid teaching advanced techniques or strategies beyond their level of understanding. It is also crucial for white belt instructors to recognize their own limitations and not overestimate their knowledge or abilities.

Another important aspect to consider is the responsibility that comes with being a teacher, even as a white belt. White belt instructors should take their role seriously and strive to provide accurate information and guidance to their students. They should also be open to feedback and willing to learn from their own mistakes and experiences.

In conclusion, while white belt instructors may be the subject of jokes and ridicule, they can also be valuable resources for beginners and for solidifying one's own understanding of the art. It is important to foster their enthusiasm and encourage them to share their knowledge responsibly, while also recognizing their limitations and ensuring that they are providing accurate and helpful guidance to their students. By doing so, we can all contribute to a positive and supportive learning environment within the Jiu-Jitsu community.
